\description{
"Alfalfa is a high protein crop that is suitable feed for dairy cows. It is thought that rent for land planted to alfalfa relative to rent for other agricultural purposes would be higher in areas with a high density of dairy cows and rent would be lower in counties where limin in required, since that would mean additional expense."
